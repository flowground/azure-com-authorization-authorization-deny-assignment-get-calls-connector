## API Description

Role based access control provides you a way to apply granular level policy administration down to individual resources or resource groups. These operations enable you to get deny assignments. A deny assignment describes the set of actions on resources that are denied for Azure Active Directory users.

## Authorization

Supported authorization schemes:
- OAuth2

For OAuth 2.0 you need to specify OAuth Client credentials as environment variables in the connector repository:
* `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` - your OAuth client id
* `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` - your OAuth client secret

## Actions

### Gets all deny assignments for the subscription.

*Tags:* `DenyAssignments`

#### Input Parameters
* `subscriptionId` - _required_ - The ID of the target subscription.
* `api-version` - _required_ - The API version to use for this operation.
* `$filter` - _optional_ - The filter to apply on the operation. Use $filter=atScope() to return all deny assignments at or above the scope. Use $filter=denyAssignmentName eq '{name}' to search deny assignments by name at specified scope. Use $filter=principalId eq '{id}' to return all deny assignments at, above and below the scope for the specified principal. Use $filter=gdprExportPrincipalId eq '{id}' to return all deny assignments at, above and below the scope for the specified principal. This filter is different from the principalId filter as it returns not only those deny assignments that contain the specified principal is the Principals list but also those deny assignments that contain the specified principal is the ExcludePrincipals list. Additionally, when gdprExportPrincipalId filter is used, only the deny assignment name and description properties are returned.
